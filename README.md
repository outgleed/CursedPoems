# CursedPoems
List of cursed poems.

Mable the Vampire | There once was a vampire named Mable,
Who's periods were quite stable.
At every full moon,
she'd take out a spoon,
and drink herself under the table.

West Vagina | WEST VAGINA, MOUNT THAT MAMA. TAKE ME HOME, WITH A GIRL AND A POLE!!!

Dogs | All these beutiful women, and you wanna go freaky with the dog.

Eating | Person 1: You are what you eat. Person 2: I am human, afterall.
